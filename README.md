# Learning-to-Code
Solutions to Project Euler

## Goal
Tackle difficult mathematical questions with different coding languages to better understand programming concepts.

## Languages
This will start with using only Javascript, since I am familiar with that langauge the most. The goal is learn additional languages along the way once solutions are found.
